# ICL-Ophthalmology-Public

This is a public repository for the code base used in the following study:

In-context learning for data-efficient classification of diabetic retinopathy with multimodal foundation models
Ayhan, M.S., Merle, D.A., ... and Keane, P.A.

Notebooks are self-explanatory; however, you will need to download and process the IDRiD images before you can run RETFound for feature extraction or finetuning. 

You may also chage the dataset for your own experiments and play with models, etc...
